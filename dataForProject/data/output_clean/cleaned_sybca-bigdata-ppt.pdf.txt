introduction to big data
what is data
the quantities characters or symbols on which operations are performed by a computer
which may be stored and transmitted in the form of electrical signals and recorded on
magnetic optical or mechanical recording media
what is big data
big data is also data but with a huge size big data is a term used to describe a
collection of data that is huge in and yet growing exponentially with time in
short such data is so large and complex that none of the traditional data management
tools are able to store it or process it efficiently
extremely large data sets that may be analyzed computationally to reveal patterns
trends and association especially relating to human behavior and interaction are
known as big data
examples of big data
following are some the examples of big data
the new york stock exchange generates about one terabyte of new trade data per day
social media
the statistic shows that terabytes of new data get ingested into the databases of social
media site facebook every day this data is mainly generated in terms of photo and video
uploads message exchanges putting comments etc
a single jet engine can generate terabytes of data in minutes of flight time with many
thousand flights per day generation of data reaches up to many petabytes

characteristics of big data
the following are known as big data characteristics
2 velocity
3 variety
4 veracity
means how much data is generated now a days
organizations or human beings or systems are generating or getting
very vast amount of data say tb tera bytes to pb peta bytes to exa
byte eb and more
2 velocity
velocity means how fast produce data now a days organizations or
human beings or systems are generating huge amounts of data at very
fast rate
3 variety
variety means different forms of data now a days organizations or
human beings or systems are generating very huge amount of data at very fast
rate in different formats we will discuss in details about different formats of
data soon
4 veracity
veracity means the quality or correctness or accuracy of captured data
out of 4vs it is most important v for any big data solutions because without
correct information or data there is no use of storing large amount of data at
fast rate and different formats that data should give correct business value
types of digital data
1 structured
2 unstructured
3 semi structured
structured
any data that can be stored accessed and processed in the form of fixed format is
termed as a structured data
over the period of time talent in computer science has achieved greater success in
developing techniques for working with such kind of data where the format is well
known in advance and also deriving value out of it
extent typical sizes are being in the range of multiple zettabytes
do you know bytes equal to 1 zettabyte or one billion terabytes forms a zettabyte
looking at these figures one can easily understand why the name big data is
given and imagine the challenges involved in its storage and processing
do you know data stored in a relational database management system is one
example of a structured data
examples of structured data
an employee table in a database is an example of structured data
employee_id
employee_name
gender
department
salary_in_lacs

unstructured
any data with unknown form or the structure is classified as unstructured data
in addition to the size being huge un structured data poses multiple challenges in terms
of its processing for deriving value out of it
a typical example of unstructured data is a heterogeneous data source containing a
combination of simple text files images videos etc
now day organizations have wealth of data available with them but unfortunately they
don t know how to derive value out of it since this data is in its raw form or unstructured
format
examples of un structured data
the output returned by google search
semi structured
semi structured data can contain both the forms of data
we can see semi structured data as a structured in form but it is actually not defined
with e g a table definition in relational dbms
example of semi structured data is a data represented in an xml file
examples of semi structured data
personal data stored in an xml file

big data analytics
big data analytics
big data analytics is the process of collecting organizing and analyzing
large sets of data called big data to discover patterns and other useful
information
big data analytics can help organizations to better understand the
information contained within the data and will also help identify the data
that is most important to the business and future business decisions
analysts working with big data typically want the knowledge that comes
from analyzing the data
high performance analytics required
to analyze such a large of data big data analytics is typically
analytics data mining text mining forecasting and data optimization
collectively these processes are separate but highly integrated functions of
high performance analytics
using big data tools and software enables an organization to process extremely
relevant and can be analyzed to drive better business decisions in the future
the challenges
for most organizations big data analysis is a challenge consider the sheer
of data and the different formats of the
data both structured and unstructured data that is collected across the entire
organization and the many different ways different types of data can be
combined contrasted and analyzed to find patterns and other useful business
information
the first challenge is in breaking down data silos to access all data an
organization stores in different places and often in different systems
a second challenge is in creating platforms that can pull in unstructured data as
easily as structured data
this massive of data is typically so large that it s difficult to process
using traditional database and software methods
how big data analytics is used today
as the technology that helps an organization to break down data silos and analyze
data improves business can be transformed in all sorts of ways
today s advances in analyzing big data allow researchers to decode human dna in
minutes predict where terrorists plan to attack determine which gene is mostly likely
to be responsible for certain diseases and of course which ads you are most likely to
respond to on facebook
another example comes from one of the biggest mobile carriers in the world
france s orange launched its data for development project by releasing subscriber
data for customers in the ivory coast
the 2 5 billion records which were made anonymous included details on calls and
text messages exchanged between 5 million users
researchers accessed the data and sent orange proposals for how the data could serve
as the foundation for development projects to improve public health and safety
proposed projects included one that showed how to improve public safety by tracking
cell phone data to map where people went after emergencies another showed how to
use cellular data for disease containment source
the benefits of big data analytics
enterprises are increasingly looking to find actionable insights into their
data many big data projects originate from the need to answer specific
business questions with the right big data analytics platforms in place an
enterprise can boost sales increase efficiency and improve operations
customer service and risk management
webopedia parent company quinstreet surveyed enterprise decision
makers involved in big data purchases to learn which business areas
companies plan to use big data analytics to improve operations about half
customer retention help with product development and gain a competitive
advantage
notably the business area getting the most attention relates to increasing
efficiency and optimizing operations specifically percent of respondents
said that they use big data analytics to improve speed and reduce complexity
