what exactly is big data
to put it simply big data is larger more
complex data sets especially from new data
sources these data sets are so voluminous that
traditional data processing software just can t
data can be used to address business problems
you wouldn t have been able to tackle before
to really understand big data it s helpful to have
some historical background here s gartner s
defnition circa which is still the go to
defnition
big data is data that contains greater variety
higher velocity this is known as the three vs
the three vs of big data
the amount of data matters with
of low density unstructured data this can be
data of unknown value such as twitter data
feeds clickstreams on a webpage or a mobile
organizations this might be tens of
terabytes of data for others it may be
hundreds of petabytes
velocity velocity is the fast rate at which data
is received and perhaps acted on normally
the highest velocity of data streams directly into
memory versus being written to disk some
internet enabled smart products operate in real
time or near real time and will require
real time evaluation and action
variety in today s big data world data
comes in new unstructured data types
unstructured and semi structured data types
such as text audio and video require addition
preprocessing to derive meaning and
velocity
variety
big data
the value and truth of
big data
value and veracity data has intrinsic value but
it s of no use until that value is discovered
equally important how truthful is your data and
how much can you rely on it
today big data has become capital think of
some of the world s biggest tech companies a
large part of the value they offer comes from
their data which they re constantly analyzing to
produce more effciency and develop
new products
recent technological breakthroughs have
exponentially reduced the cost of data storage
and compute making it easier and less expensive
to store more data than ever before with an
increased of big data now cheaper and
more accessible you can make more accurate
and precise business decisions
finding value in big data isn t only about
analyzing it which is a whole other beneft
it s an entire discovery process that requires
insightful analysts business users and
executives who ask the right questions recognize
patterns make informed assumptions and
predict behavior
but how did we get here
the history
of big data
around people began to realize just how
much data users generated through facebook
youtube and other online services hadoop an
open source framework created specifcally to
store and analyze big data sets was developed
that same year nosql also began to gain
popularity during this time
the development of open source frameworks
such as hadoop and more recently spark was
essential for the growth of big data because they
make big data easier to work with and cheaper to
store in the years since then the of big
data has skyrocketed users are still generating
huge amounts of data but it s not just humans
with the advent of internet of things iot more
objects and devices are connected to the internet
gathering data on customer usage patterns and
product performance the emergence of machine
learning has produced still more data
while big data has come far its popularity is only
just beginning cloud computing has expanded
big data possibilities even further
the cloud offers a truly elastic scalability where
developers can just spin up ad hoc clusters to
test around a subset of data it s an exciting time
benefits of big data and
data analytics
the value of big data comes is twofold
1 big data makes it possible for you to gain
more complete answers because you have
more information
2 more complete answers means more
confdence in the data which means
tackling problems
big data
use cases
this new knowledge enables you to handle use
cases that you haven t been able to fully delve
into before here are just a few more use cases
are on our solutions page
product development
companies like netfix and procter gamble
use big data to anticipate customer demand
by classifying key attributes of past and current
products or services and then modeling the
relationship between those attributes and the
commercial success of the offerings they build
predictive models for new products and services
in addition p g uses data and analytics from
focus groups social media test markets and
early store rollouts to plan produce and launch
new products
predictive maintenance
factors that can predict mechanical failures may
be deeply buried in structured data such as the
equipment year make and model as well as
in unstructured data that covers millions of log
entries senor data error messages and engine
temperature by analyzing these indications of
organizations can deploy maintenance more cost
effectively and maximize parts and
equipment uptime
customer experience
the race for customers is on a clearer view of
customer experience is more possible now than
ever before big data enables you to gather data
from social media web visits call logs and
other data sources to improve the interaction
experience and maximize the value delivered
start delivering personalized offers reduce
fraud and compliance
when it comes to security it s not just a few
rogue hackers you re up against entire expert
teams security landscapes and compliance
requirements are constantly evolving big
data helps you identify patterns in data that
information to make regulatory reporting
much faster
machine learning
machine learning is the hottest of hot topics right
now and data specifcally big data is one of
the reasons why it s only recently that we ve
been able to teach machines instead of program
them and the availability of big data to train
operational efficiency
operational effciency may not always make the
news but it s an area in which big data is having
the most impact with big data you can analyze
and assess production customer feedback and
returns and other factors to reduce outages and
anticipate future demands big data can also be
used to improve decision making in line with
current market demand
drive innovation
big data can help you innovate by studying
interdependencies between humans institutions
entities and process and then determining new
ways to use those insights use data insights to
improve decisions about fnancial and planning
considerations examine trends and what
customers want to deliver new products and
services implement dynamic pricing there are
endless possibilities
big data challenges
while big data holds a lot of promise it is not
without its challenges
first big data is big although new
technologies have been developed to store data
two years organizations still struggle to keep
pace with their data and fnd ways to effectively
store it
but it s not enough to just store the data data
must be used to be valuable and that depends
on curation clean data or data that s relevant
to the client and organized in a way that enables
meaningful analysis requires a lot of work
data scientists spend to percent of their
time curating and preparing data before it can
actually be used
finally big data technology is changing at a fast
pace a few years ago apache hadoop was the
popular technology used to handle big data that
is until apache spark was introduced in
today a combination of the two frameworks
big data technology is an ongoing challenge

integrate
analyze
manage
adaptive
intelligence
big data gives you new insights that open up
started involves three key actions
integrate
big data brings together data from many
data integration mechanisms such as etl
extract transform and load generally aren t
up to the task it requires new strategies and
technologies to analyze big data sets at terabyte
or even petabyte scale at the same time big
data has the same requirements for quality
governance and confdence as traditional data
sources during integration you need to bring in
the data process it and make sure it s formatted
and available in a form that your business
analysts can get started with
manage
big data requires storage your storage solution
can be in the cloud on premises or both
you can store your data in any form you want
and bring your desired processing requirements
and necessary process engines to those data sets
on an on demand basis many people choose
their storage solution according to where their
data is currently residing the cloud is gradually
current compute requirements and enables you
to spin up resources as needed
analyze
your investment in big data pays off when you
analyze and act on your data get new clarity with
a visual analysis of your varied data sets explore
the data further to make new discoveries share
your fndings with others build data models with
machine learning and artifcial intelligence put
your data to work
to help you on your big data journey we ve put
together some key best practices for you to keep
in mind here are our guidelines for building a
successful big data foundation
big data
best practices
1 align big data with
specific business goals
more extensive data sets enable you to make
new discoveries to that end it is important to
base new investments in skills organization
or infrastructure with a strong business
driven context to guarantee ongoing project
investments and funding to determine if
you are on the right track ask how big data
priorities examples include understanding how
to flter web logs to understand ecommerce
behavior deriving sentiment from social
understanding statistical correlation methods
and their relevance for customer product
manufacturing and engineering data
2 ease skills shortage
with standards and
governance
one of the biggest obstacles to big data is a skills
shortage you can mitigate this risk by ensuring
that big data technologies considerations
and decisions are added to your it
governance program
to manage costs and leverage resources
organizations implementing big data
solutions and strategies should assess their
skill requirements early and often and should
proactively identify any potential skill gaps these
can be addressed by training cross training
existing resources hiring new resources and
leveraging consulting frms
3 optimize knowledge
transfer with a center
of excellence
knowledge control oversight and manage
project communications whether big data is a
new or an expanding investment the soft and
hard costs can be shared across the enterprise
big data capabilities and overall information
architecture maturity in a more structured and
systematic way
4 top payoff is aligning
unstructured with
structured data
it is certainly valuable to analyze big data on its
own but you can bring even greater business
insights by connecting and integrating low
density big data with the structured data you are
already using today
whether you are capturing customer product
equipment or environmental big data the goal
is to add more relevant data points to your
core master and analytical summaries leading
to better conclusions for example there is
a difference in distinguishing all customer
sentiment from that of only your best customers
which is why many see big data as an integral
extension of their existing business intelligence
capabilities data warehousing platform and
information architecture
keep in mind that the big data analytical
processes and models can be both human and
machine based big data analytical capabilities
include statistics spatial analysis semantics
interactive discovery and visualization using
analytical models you can correlate different
types and sources of data to make associations
and meaningful discoveries
5 plan your discovery lab
for performance
discovering meaning in your data is not always
straightforward sometimes we don t even
know what we re looking for that s expected
of direction or lack of clear requirement
at the same time it s important for analysts and
data scientists to work closely with the business
to understand key business knowledge gaps and
requirements to accommodate the interactive
exploration of data and the experimentation of
statistical algorithms you need high performance
work areas be sure that sandbox environments
have the power they need and are
properly governed
6 align with the cloud
operating model
big data processes and users require access
to broad array of resources for both iterative
experimentation and running production
jobs a big data solution includes all data
realms including transactions master data
reference data and summarized data analytical
sandboxes should be created on demand
resource management is critical to ensure
control of the entire data fow including pre
and post processing integration in database
summarization and analytical modeling a well
planned private and public cloud provisioning
and security strategy plays an integral role in
put big data
to work
clearly big data has tremendous potential
putting a big data initiative to work at your
organization can help you better understand your
customers make more accurate decisions and
learn more
