today big data draws a lot of attention in the it world the rapid rise of the internet and the digital economy has
fuelled an exponential growth in demand for data storage and analytics and it department are facing tremendous
collecting and storing more data than ever before is because their business depends on it the type of information
being created is no more traditional database driven data referred to as structured data rather it is data that
include documents images audio video and social media contents known as unstructured data or big data big
take proactive actions and give way to better strategic decision making further this paper analyzes the adoption
usage and impact of to the business value of an enterprise to improve its competitive advantage
using a set of data algorithms for large data sets such as hadoop and mapreduce
big data analytics hadoop mapreduce
introduction
traditional database big data consists of different types of key technologies like hadoop hdfs nosql
mapreduce mongodb cassandra pig hive and hbase that work together to achieve the end goal like
extracting value from data that would be previously considered dead according to a recent market report published
by transparency market research the total value of big data was estimated at 6 3 billion as of but by
it s expected to reach the staggering level of 3 billion that s almost a percent increase forrester
research estimates that organizations effectively utilize less than 5 percent of their available data this is because
the rest is simply too expensive to deal with big data is derived from multiple sources it involves not just
traditional relational data but all paradigms of unstructured data sources that are growing at a significant rate for
instance machine derived data multiplies quickly and contains rich diverse content that needs to be discovered
another example human derived data from social media is more textual but the valuable insights are often
overloaded with many possible meanings
reflect the challenges of data that are too vast too unstructured and too fast moving to be
managed by traditional methods from businesses and research institutions to governments organizations now
routinely generate data of unprecedented scope and complexity gleaning meaningful information and competitive
advantages from massive amounts of data has become increasingly important to organizations globally trying to
efficiently extract the meaningful insights from such data sources quickly and easily is challenging thus analytics
has become inextricably vital to realize the full value of big data to improve their business performance and
increase their market share the tools available to handle the velocity and variety of big data have
improved greatly in recent years in general these technologies are not prohibitively expensive and much of the
software is open source hadoop the most commonly used framework combines commodity hardware with open
source software it takes incoming streams of data and distributes them onto cheap disks it also provides tools for
analyzing the data however these technologies do require a skill set that is new to most it departments which will
need to work hard to integrate all the relevant internal and external sources of data although attention to technology
isn t sufficient it is always a necessary component of a big data strategy this paper discusses some of the most
commonly used big data technologies mostly open source that work together as a system for
leveraging large quantities of unstructured data to make more informed decisions
review of literature
capture storage and analysis data sources extend beyond the traditional corporate database to include emails
mobile device outputs and sensor generated data where data is no longer restricted to structured database records
but rather unstructured data having no standard formatting since big data and analytics is a relatively new
and evolving phrase there is no uniform definition various stakeholders have provided diverse and sometimes
contradictory definitions one of the first widely quoted definitions of big data resulted from the gartner report of
gartner proposed that big data is defined by three v s velocity and variety gartner expanded its
definition in to include veracity representing requirements about trust and uncertainty pertaining to data and
the outcome of data analysis in a report idc defined the 4th v as value highlighting that big data
information from call logs mobile banking transactions online user generated content such as blog posts and
tweets online searches and images which can be transformed into valuable business information using
computational techniques to unveil trends and patterns between datasets
another dimension of the big data definition involves technology big data is not only large and complex but it
requires innovative technology to analyze and process in the national institute of standard and technology
technology big data exceed the capacity or capability of current or conventional methods and systems and enable
practitioners have difficulties to incorporate it into their complex decision making that adds business value in
mckinsey company conducted a survey of 1 executives across various regions industries and company
sizes in which percent of respondents said that their companies are focusing big data efforts on cuser
insights segmentation and targeting to improve overall performance an even higher number of respondents
percent said their companies should focus efforts on using data and analytics to generate these insights yet just
one fifth said that their organizations have fully deployed data and analytics to generate insights in one business unit
or function and only percent use data to generate insights across the company as these survey results show the
question is no longer whether big data can help business but how can business derive maximum results from big
predictive analytics
predictive analytics is the use of historical data to forecast on consumer behavior and trends it is the use of
past historical data to predict future trends this analysis makes use of the statistical models and machine learning
algorithms to identify patterns and learn from historical data predictive analysis can also be defined as a
process that uses machine learning to analyze data and make predictions
sixty seven percent of businesses aim at using predictive analytics to create more strategic marketing campaign in
future and sight competitive advantage as the prime benefit of predictive analysis broadly speaking
search typically a large e commerce site offers thousands of product and services for sale navigating and
searching for a product out of thousands on a website could be a major setback to consumers however with the
closely suit the consumer s taste
using a technology called collaborative filtering a database of historical user preferences is created when a new
cuser access the ecommerce site the cuser is matched with the database of preferences in order to discover a
preference class that closely matches the cuser taste these products are then recommended to the cuser
another technology that is used in ecommerce is the clustering algorithm clustering algorithm works by identifying
groups of users that have similar preferences these users are then clustered into a single group and are given a
unique identifier
new cusers cluster are predicted by calculating the average similarities of the individual members in that cluster
hence a user could be a partial member of more than one cluster depending of the weight of the user s average
opinion advanced analytics is defined as the scientific process of transforming data into insight for making
better decisions as a formal discipline advanced analytics have grown under the operational research domain
there are some fields that have considerable overlap with analytics and also different accepted classifications for
the types of analytics 2
big data technologies
apache flume
apache flume is a distributed reliable and available system for efficiently collecting aggregating and moving large
amounts of log data from many different sources to a centralized data store flume deploys as one or more agents
each contained within its own instance of the java virtual machine jvm agents consist of three pluggable
components sources sinks and channels flume agents ingest incoming streaming data from one or more sources
data ingested by a flume agent is passed to a sink which is most commonly a distributed file system like hadoop
multiple flume agents can be connected together for more complex workflows by configuring the source of one
agent to be the sink of another flume sources listen and consume events events can range from newline terminated
strings in stdout to http posts and rpc calls it all depends on what sources the agent is configured to use
flume agents may have more than one source but at the minimum they require one sources require a name and a
type the type then dictates additional configuration parameters
channels are the mechanism by which flume agents transfer events from their sources to their sinks events written
to the channel by a source are not removed from the channel until a sink removes that event in a transaction this
allows flume sinks to retry writes in the event of a failure in the external repository such as hdfs or an outgoing
network connection for example if the network between a flume agent and a hadoop cluster goes down the
channel will keep all events queued until the sink can correctly write to the cluster and close its transactions with the
channel sink is an interface implementation that can remove events from a channel and transmit them to the next
agent in the flow or to the event s final destination and also sinks can remove events from the channel in
transactions and write them to output transactions close when the event is successfully written ensuring that all
events are committed to their final destination
apache sqoop
apache sqoop is a cli tool designed to transfer data between hadoop and relational databases sqoop can import
data from an rdbms such as mysql or oracle database into hdfs and then export the data back after data has
been transformed using mapreduce sqoop also has the ability to import data into hbase and hive sqoop connects
to an rdbms through its jdbc connector and relies on the rdbms to describe the database schema for data to be
imported both import and export utilize mapreduce which provides parallel operation as well as fault tolerance
during import sqoop the table row by row into hdfs because import is performed in parallel the output in
hdfs is multiple files
apache pig
apache s pig is a major project which is lying on top of hadoop and provides higher level language to use
hadoop s mapreduce library pig provides the scripting language to describe operations like the reading filtering
and transforming joining and writing data which are exactly the same operations that mapreduce was originally
designed for instead of expressing these operations in thousands of lines of java code which uses mapreduce
directly apache pig lets the users express them in a language that is not unlike a bash or perl script
pig was initially developed at yahoo research around but moved into the apache software foundation in
unlike sql pig does not require that the data must have a schema so it is well suited to process the
complete like sql which means it is at least as powerful as a relational algebra turing completeness requires
conditional constructs an infinite memory model and looping constructs
apache hive
hive is a technology developed by facebook that turns hadoop into a data warehouse complete with a dialect of
sql for querying being a sql dialect hiveql is a declarative language in piglatin you specify the data flow
but in hive we describe the result we want and hive figures out how to build a data flow to achieve that result
unlike pig in hive a schema is required but you are not limited to only one schema like piglatin and sql
hiveql itself is a relationally complete language but it is not a turing complete language
apache zookeeper
apache zoo keeper is an effort to develop and maintain an open source server which enables highly reliable
distributed coordination it provides a distributed configuration service a synchronization service and a naming
configuration information zookeeper is especially fast with workloads where to the data are more common
than writes the ideal write ratio is about 1 zookeeper is replicated over a set of hosts called an ensemble
and the servers are aware of each other and there is no single point of failure
figure 1 intel manager for hadoop 3
mongodb
mongodb is an open source document oriented nosql database that has lately attained some space in the data
industry it is considered as one of the most popular nosql databases competing today and favors master slave
replication the role of master is to perform and writes whereas the slave confines to copy the data received
from master to perform the operation and backup the data the slaves do not participate in write operations
but may select an alternate master in case of the current master failure mongodb uses binary format of json like
documents underneath and believes in dynamic schemas unlike the traditional relational databases the query
system of mongodb can return particular fields and query set compass search by fields range queries regular
expression search etc and may include the user defined complex javascript functions as hinted already
mongodb practice flexible schema and the document structure in a grouping called collection may vary and
common fields of various documents in a collection can have disparate types of the data
develop the cusized systems that use mongodb as their backend player there is an increasingly demand of
in order to efficiently address the challenges of big data the leading vendor developed the oracle nosql database
it was built by oracle berkeley db team and the berkeley db java edition is the building block of oracle nosql
berkeley db is a robust and scalable key value store and used as the underlying storage for several popular data
model such as amazon dynamo geniedb memcachedb and voldemort
there are several other database systems that discern the strength of berkeley db and have attained greater
scalability throughput and reliability with little tuning efforts it is an efficient and a resilient transaction model that
oracle database and hadoop it offers scalable throughput with bounded latency the model very well
accommodates the horizontal scaling with dynamic annexation of new capacity citing high availability the design
of high availability rapid failover in the event of a node failure etc are achieved by replicating the storage nodes
apache cassandra
apache cassandra is the yet another open source nosql database solution that has gained industrial reputation
which is able to handle big data requirements it is a highly scalable and high performance distributed database
businesses it has a built for scale architecture that can handle petabytes of information and thousands of concurrent
users operations per second as easily as it can manage much smaller amount of data and user traffic it has a peer to
peer design that offers no single point of failure for any database process or function in addition to the location
independence capabilities that equate to a true network independent method of storing and accessing data data can
data is represented in cassandra via column families that are dynamic in nature and accommodate all modifications
online
apache hadoop
the apache hadoop software library is a framework that enables the distributed processing of large data sets across
clusters of computers it is designed to scale up from single servers to thousands of machines with each offering
local computation and storage the basic notion is to allow a single query to find and collect results from all the
technological challenges in software systems research today is to provide mechanisms for storage manipulation and
information retrieval on large amount of data web services and social media produce together an impressive
amount of data reaching the scale of petabytes daily facebook these data may contain valuable
information which sometimes is not properly explored by existing systems most of this data is stored in a non
structured manner using different languages and format which in many cases are in compatible
parallel and distributed computing currently has a fundamental role in data processing and information extraction of
large datasets over the last years commodity hardware became part of clusters since the x86 platform cope with
the need of having an overall better cost performance ratio while decreasing maintenance cost apache hadoop is a
manipulation of large amount of data the framework was designed over the mapreduce paradigm and uses the
hdfs as a storage file system hadoop presents key characteristics when performing parallel and distributed
computing such as data integrity availability scalability exception handling and failure recovery
hadoop is a popular choice when you need to filter sort or pre process large amounts of new data in place and
distill it to generate denser data that theoretically contains more information pre processing involves filtering new
data sources to make them suitable for additional analysis in a data warehouse hadoop is a top level open source
distributions packaging the basic software stack with other hadoop software projects such as apache hive apache
pig and apache sqoop these distributions must integrate with data warehouses databases and other data
management products so data can move among hadoop clusters and other environments to expand the data pool to
process or query
figure 2 data architecture with hadoop integrated with existing data system
mapreduce is the original massively scalable parallel processing framework commonly used with hadoop and
other components such as the hadoop distributed file system hdfs and yarn yarn can be described as a
large scale distributed operating system for big data implementations as hadoop has matured the batch oriented
streaming processing and advanced implementations such as the aforementioned machine learning
mapreduce
mapreduce is the model of distributed data processing introduced by google in the fundamental concept of
mapreduce is to divide problems into two parts a map function that processes source data into sufficient statistics
and a reduce function that merges all sufficient statistics into a final answer by definition any number of
concurrent map functions can be run at the same time without intercommunication once all the data has had the
batch processing and high speed data retrieval common in web search scenarios mapreduce provides the fastest
most cost effective and most scalable mechanism for returning results today most of the leading technologies for
managing big data are developed on mapreduce with mapreduce there are few scalability limitations but
leveraging it directly does require writing and maintaining a lot of code
apache splunk
splunk is a general purpose search analysis and reporting engine for time series text data typically machine data
compliance it operations management and providing analytics for the business the splunk engine is optimized for
quickly indexing and persisting unstructured data loaded into the system specifically splunk uses a minimal
schema for persisted data events consist only of the raw event text implied timestamp source typically the
filename for file based inputs source type an indication of the general type of data and host where the data
originated
once data enters the splunk system it quickly proceeds through processing is persisted in its raw form and is
indexed by the above fields along with all the in the raw event text indexing is an essential element of the
canonical super grep use case for splunk but it also makes most retrieval tasks faster any more sophisticated
processing on these raw events is deferred until search time this serves four important goals indexing speed is
increased as minimal processing is performed bringing new data into the system is a relatively low effort exercise as
no schema planning is needed the original data is persisted for easy inspection and the system is resilient to change
as data parsing problems do not require reloading or re indexing the data
big data framework
apache spark
apache spark an open source big data processing framework built around speed ease of use and sophisticated
analytics it was originally developed in in uc berkeley s amp lab and open sourced in as an apache
project hadoop as a big data processing technology has been around for ten years and has proven to be the solution
of choice for processing large data sets mapreduce is a great solution for one pass computations but not very
efficient for use cases that require multi pass computations and algorithms each step in the data processing
workflow has one map phase and one reduce phase and you ll need to convert any use case into mapreduce pattern
to leverage this solution spark takes mapreduce to the next level with less expensive shuffles in the data
processing with capabilities like in memory data storage and near real time processing the performance can be
several times faster than other big data technologies
workflows it provides a higher level api to improve developer productivity and a consistent architect model for big
data solutions spark holds intermediate results in memory rather than writing them to disk which is very useful
especially when you need to work on the same dataset multiple times it s designed to be an execution engine that
works both in memory and on disk spark operators perform external operations when data does not fit in memory
spark can be used for processing datasets that larger than the aggregate memory in a cluster spark will attempt to
store as much as data in memory and then will spill to disk it can store part of a data set in memory and the
remaining data on the disk you have to look at your data and use cases to assess the memory requirements with
this in memory data storage spark comes with a great performance advantage
programming languages like scala java python clojure and r other than spark core api there are additional
libraries that are part of the spark ecosystem and provide additional capabilities in spark
streaming is one among the spark library that can be used for processing the real time streaming data this is based
on micro based on micro batch style of computing and processing spark sql provides the capabilities to expose the
spark datasets over jdbc api and allow running the sql like queries on spark data using traditional bi and
visualization tools mllib graphx are some other libraries from spark
competitive advantages
thomas h davenport was perhaps the first to observe in his harvard business review article published in january
competing on analytics how companies who orientated themselves around fact based management
reality is that it takes continuous improvement to become an analytics driven organization in a presentation given at
the strata new york conference in september mckinsey company showed the eye opening year
category growth rate differences see figure 7 below between businesses that smartly use their big data and those
that do not
amazon uses big data to monitor track and secure 1 5 billion items in its inventory that are laying around
when a cuser will purchase a product and pre ship it to a depot close to the final destination wal mart handles
more than a million cuser transactions each hour imports information into databases to contain more than
can generate to times the data of conventional bar code systems ups deployment of telematics in their
freight segment helped in their global redesign of logistical networks 6 amazon is a big data giant and the largest
online retail store the company pioneered e commerce in many different ways but one of its biggest successes was
the personalized recommendation system which was built from the big data it gathers from its millions of
cusers transactions
the u s federal government collects more than raw and geospatial datasets from agencies and sub
access to information not deemed private or classified professional social network linkedin uses data from its more
than million users to build new social products based on users own definitions of their skill sets silver spring
networks deploys smart two way power grids for its utility cusers that utilize digital technology to deliver more
reliable energy to consumers from multiple sources and allow homeowners to send information back to utilities to
trends to identify problems with its healthcare system revealing services that were both medically ineffective and
expensive
conclusion
today s technology landscape is changing fast organizations of all shapes and sizes are being pressured to be data
driven and to do more with less even though big data technologies are still in a nascent stage relatively speaking
the impact of the 3v s of big data which now is 5v s cannot be ignored the time is now for organizations to begin
planning for and building out their hadoop based data lake organizations with the right infrastructures talent and
they can use big data to unveil new patterns and trends gain additional insights and begin to find answers to
what s learned the more likely they are to reveal answers that can add value to the top line of the business this is
where the returns on big data investments multiply and the transformation begins harnessing big data insight
data driven decisions always tend to be better decisions
